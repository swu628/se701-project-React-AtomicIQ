# AtomicIQ

> Created by Group 5 for SOFTENG 701 Assignment 7. There are features that are currently available on the site which are still work in progress.

AtomicIQ is a state-of-the-art chemistry learning web app which is designed specifically for learning the periodic table of elements included in the Year 11, IGCSE Syllabus for 2024. The app features interactive learning activites, flash card quizzes for revision, and a wordle-inspired quiz named Elementle for assessing and evaluating the user's knowledge of the elements in a fun and interactive fashion.

## Disclosure

Due to the limited time available for the implementation of this tool, there are some features present on the application which are not functioning as they are meant to. Any instance of these functions would result in a popup appearing, indicating that this feature is work-in-progress and is not implemented yet.

In addition, the maximum level a user can reach is currently level 3, as there is not enough content implemented for the user to utilize beyond that at this stage.
